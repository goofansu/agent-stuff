  Use acli to interact with Atlassian Jira from the command line. Use when the
  user wants to: create, view, edit, search, or delete Jira issues/work items,
  transition issue status (e.g. move to "In Progress" or "Done"), add or list
  comments, assign issues, search with JQL, manage sprints or boards, bulk

# Jira Skill

Use `acli` to interact with Atlassian Jira from the command line.

## Prerequisites

Verify `acli` is installed:

```bash
which acli
```

If not found, tell the user:
> `acli` is not installed. Please install it: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/guides/install-acli/

If a command fails with an authentication error, run `acli jira auth status` to check the current session. For auth setup, see [references/JIRA_AUTH.md](references/JIRA_AUTH.md).
